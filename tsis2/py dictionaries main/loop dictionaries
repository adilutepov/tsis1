Example 1
Print all key names in the dictionary, one by one:

for x in thisdict:
  print(x)
 
Example 2
Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:

for x in thisdict:
  print(thisdict[x])

Example 3
You can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:

for x in thisdict.values():
  print(x)

Example 4
You can use the keys() method to return the keys of a dictionary:

for x in thisdict.keys():
  print(x)

Example 5
Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:

for x, y in thisdict.items():
  print(x, y)
