Example 1
Print all items in the list, one by one:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in thislist:
  print(x)

Example 2
Print all items by referring to their index number:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(thislist)):
  print(thislist[i])
  
 Example 3
Print all items, using a while loop to go through all the index numbers

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
i = 0
while i < len(thislist):
  print(thislist[i])
  i = i + 1

Example 4
A short hand for loop that will print all items in a list:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
[print(x) for x in thislist]
