Example 1
Print each fruit in a fruit list:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)

Example 2
Loop through the letters in the word "banana":

for x in "banana":
  print(x)

Example 3
Exit the loop when x is "banana":

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break

Example 4
Exit the loop when x is "banana", but this time the break comes before the print:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    break
  print(x) 

Example 5
Do not print banana:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x)

Example 6
Using the range() function:

for x in range(6):
  print(x)

Example 7
Using the start parameter:

for x in range(2, 6):
  print(x)

Example 8
Increment the sequence with 3 (default is 1):

for x in range(2, 30, 3):
  print(x)

Example 9
Print all numbers from 0 to 5, and print a message when the loop has ended:

for x in range(6):
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")

Example 10
Break the loop when x is 3, and see what happens with the else block:

for x in range(6):
  if x == 3: break
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")

Example 11
Print each adjective for every fruit:

adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in adj:
  for y in fruits:
    print(x, y)
 
Example 12
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
